# Data sets

The dataset I chose that interests me is the NOAA Climactic Dataset found on the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information website. The potential uses for the datasetsare weather and climate data taken from marine, land-based and weather balloon collection that can be used in modeling predictions for climate change, or as environmental variables in ecological studies (such as temperature affects on species ranges).   The link to the site is [NOAA Climate Data](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access). 

# Data Science Book

The data science book I chose that interests me is title: "Data Science: An Introduction" in Wikibooks because I don't have much coding or data science experience beyond performing statistical analyses using RStudio, so I'm very much a beginner. I feel like this would be a good place to start. (link: [Data Science:An Introduction](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Data_Science:_An_Introduction)
